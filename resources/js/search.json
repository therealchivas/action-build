The output files can then be pushed back to GitHub, or sent by FTP to another web server, or any other form of website publication target.","This action will look for a retype.yml file in the repository root."]},{"l":"Usage"},{"i":"optional-setup-dotnet-step","l":"Optional: setup-dotnet step","p":["It may be useful to include the actions/setup-dotnet step before retypeapp/action-build@latest. With this, the Build Action can install the dotnet tool Retype package.","The workflow file above would then become:","If this is not included though, the action will still work, but it may need to use the NPM package in case the installed .NET version is not the one required by Retype. When resorting to the NPM package it may take a bit longer to set up the workflow due to the larger download size. It may also be the case that the GitHub runner is an unsupported OS by the NPM packages; as long as it has .NET installed, Retype should work regardless of the OS. But the NPM package is built targetted to specific OS'es, namely Linux, Mac and Windows."]},{"l":"Inputs","p":["Configuration of the project should be done in the projects retype.yml file."]},{"l":"config","p":["Specifies the path where retype.yml file should be located or path to the specific configuration file."]},{"l":"license","p":["Specifies the license key to be used with Retype.","NOTICE: The license key value cannot be saved directly to your configuration file.

Then from the subsequent job(s), the artifact can be retrieved using the download-artifact action.","The following sample demonstrates the upload-artifact and download-artifact actions."]},{"l":"Uploading the output as an artifact","p":["To use the Retype output in another job within the same workflow, or let an external source download it, it is possible to use actions/upload-artifact to persist the files.
